# Linux System & Network Configuration â€“ IE2012 Project

This repository contains the coursework for the Systems and Network Programming module (IE2012). It focuses on configuring and managing Linux systems through practical tasks in a virtualized environment.

## Project Overview

This project provides hands-on experience with essential Linux system administration and network configuration skills. The tasks are carried out within a virtual machine (Ubuntu/CentOS), simulating real-world scenarios.

## Objectives

- Understand Linux system components and basic command-line usage
- Set up and manage essential network services (DHCP, DNS, NTP)
- Automate system tasks using shell scripting
- Configure secure remote access using SSH
- Implement firewall and ACL-based network security
- Apply security best practices for network interface configuration

## Tasks Summary

### 1. Basics of Linux Environments
- VM setup with VirtualBox
- File system navigation and command-line basics
- System information and user management

### 2. Network Services Configuration
- Install and configure `isc-dhcp-server`
- Set up DNS with BIND or public DNS
- Sync time using NTP client

### 3. Shell Scripting & Security
- Create cron-based scripts for:
  - System info reporting
  - Backup of critical directories
- Configure SSH server for secure remote access
- Set firewall rules using `iptables`
- Define ACL rules for specific access control scenarios

### 4. Security Best Practices
- Apply 5 recommended security practices post Linux installation

## Tools & Technologies

- Ubuntu
- VirtualBox
- Bash Shell
- SSH
- iptables
- cron
- BIND, isc-dhcp-server, NTP

## Deliverables

-  A fully configured Linux VM image
-  A detailed report explaining all steps and configurations
